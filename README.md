# Final-Project

First, please be sure to upload all of the images in the "Artist Pictures" file in this github repository to your Google Colab.
The code we wrote for you to see a picture of the artist we chose for you based on your sign will not work unless you have the images in "Files."

Second, all of the code that we have written is in "Main_File". All you need to do is run everything in the file in order to experience our project.

The first block of code is optional, and you can use it to upload all of the images in the "Artist Pictures" file.
You can use that or just drag and drop the images from the folder into the "Files" section of Google Colab.

The next 4 are our actual program, and the last 4 blocks contain code we wrote but did not include in the program.

Enjoy!
