# Final-Project

First, please be sure to upload all of the images in the "Artist Pictures" file in this github repository.
The code we wrote for you to see a picture of the artist we chose for you based on your sign will not work unless you have the images in your directory.

Second, all of the code that we have written is in "Main_File". All you need to do is run everything in the file in order to experience our project.

Things you need to make sure are installed prior to running this code:
1. lyricsgenius (!pip install lyricsgenius)
2. textblob (!pip install textblob)
3. textblob.download_corpora (!python -m textblob.download_corpora)
4. pillow (!pip install pillow)

Everything else will be imported when you run our program! Enjoy!
