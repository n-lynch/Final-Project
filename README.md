# Final-Project

First, please be sure to upload all of the images in the "Artist Images" file in this github repository to your Google Colab.
The code we wrote for you to see a picture of the artist we chose for you based on your sign will not work unless you have the images in "Files."

Second, all of the code that we have written is in "Main_File". All you need to do is run everything in the file in order to experience our project.

The first block of code is optional, and you can use it to upload all of the images in the "Artist Images" file.
You can use that or just drag and drop the images from the folder into the "Files" section of Google Colab.

The next 4 blocks you run are our actual program:
1. Installation and importation of things you need to run the code
2. Assigning you an artist and song based off of your artist
3. A photo of your artist
4. Lyrics + text analysis of the song you chose, and lyrics + text analysis of another song of your choise.

The last 4 blocks contain code we wrote but did not include in the program.
 
Enjoy!
